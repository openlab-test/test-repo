Test topics in repo

Each repo must have a topic. We must provide a list of topics:

- ML (classical machine learning)
- QML (quantum machine learning)
- QTI (quantum technology initiative)

Each repo must fit in at least one of the above topics.

To add a topic, go inside the repository and change the topic list in the repo `About` settings on the right of the page.

From the list of repositories in the organization (not in the `Overview`), each repo appears with its
assigned topics.  
Repos can also be filtered within the organization with the keyword search:`topic:<topic>`
